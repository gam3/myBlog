title: Set up a debian postfix relay host
date: 14/04/2016

# Overview

Here we have a roaming laptop that we wish to have connect to a relay
host and send mail over an TLS connection using authentication.

In this case we control both the server and the client. If you are using
your ISP's relay host this should work. You can just skip the section on
server setup.

# On the client:

# On the server:

~~~ 
Install libsasl2-modules, sasl2-bin
Create a file /etc/postfix/sasl/smtpd.conf:
pwcheck_method: auxprop
auxprop_plugin: sasldb
mech_list: plain login
Add an user to sasldb2
 ~# saslpasswd2 -c -u domain user
 ~# sasldblistusers2
Postfix needs /etc/sasldb2 in his chroot environment. One solution is to change init script to copy sasldb2 at startup.
In /etc/init.d/postfix, add etc/sasldb2 in the variable FILES :
        FILES="etc/localtime etc/services etc/resolv.conf etc/hosts \
            etc/host.conf etc/nsswitch.conf etc/nss_mdns.config etc/sasldb2"
Edit Postfix configuration:
~# postconf -e 'smtpd_sasl_local_domain = $myhostname'
~# postconf -e 'smtpd_sasl_auth_enable = yes'
~# postconf -e 'smtpd_sasl_security_options = noanonymous'
Restart (reloading is not enough) postfix:
~# service postfix restart
~# systemctl daemon-reload
That's it, you're done, everything should work fine now.
