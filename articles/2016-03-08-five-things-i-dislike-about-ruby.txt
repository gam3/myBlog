5. It does not have a line directive see my [pull request](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/911).
4. The _begin_, _end_ syntax.  I assume this is just from my years of programming in _C_.
   * Fortunately VIM can mitigate this problem. 
3. The way the methods are searched for (research this more).
2. The way Classes are searched.
1. The Singleton Module.  But I never use it, so no problem there.
